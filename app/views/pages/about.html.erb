          <p class="text-center">Everywhere Software is a technology company founded by Dontrell Washington.</p>

          <p class="text-center"> My goal is simplifying the relationship between client and developer. Too often,
            developers fail to
            communicate with clients throughout the development stages of a project, resulting in a product that fails
            to
            reach the customer's end goal.</p>
          <p class="text-center">For this reason, I utilize a development pattern that focuses on constant communication
            and transparent
            design templates. My projects are crafted to the client's specifications by giving daily updates. This
            ensures
            a product aligning with the client's objective. The end result is the right product.</p>

                  My target is businesses who want to enhance their website. In today's economy, having a user experience that mirrors popular websites is vital. The portfolio has tons of templates to choose from. If no templates match your business, simply draw a blueprint of what you want and contact me for more details on the timeline. If you plan on getting into software development, check out the blog. As I've grown as a developer, it's noticeable how much research you put in on a daily basis. The blog is filled with resources on topics you're going to run across. The blog also has code examples so you can see exactly how the code should look in your text editor.

                  On a personal note, the world of web development and software engineering is huge in my life today. I started Everywhere Software to express my passion for building software. As a creator who's loves math, building software
                  is the perfect mix of creativity and logic.

                  From lesson planning to student's academic achievement, teaching requires full commitment and dedication to your job. On a daily basis, hitting goals are paramount. Its also vital to have an energetic and positive personality. Your days are spent making sure student's identify their potential and its best to do that with a positive personality. These traits can translate to any field.

                If I'm choose the language, Rails is my choice. This website was actually build using Ruby on Rails. On project build, I like how Rails has an MVC pattern setup and Sass implementation for professional organization. Another reason I like Rails is because most of my favorite websites were built using it. Hulu, Bleacher Report, Github, and Twitter are all websites I use that were of built using Rails. There are also tons of Rubygems to enhance the capabilities of your application.

              <p>
                Like most people, javascript is the first language I learned. If you're new to coding, I would recommend starting with JS. Its also the most popular language used today. It can handle both front-end and back-end development. When building software, there are tons of options to choose from. Angular and React are the two most popular frameworks. I use Angular the majority of the time. For back-end development, javascript uses Node.js for client-side scripting. Some popular websites and phone apps using Angular and Reacts are Facebook, Instagram, Airbnb, Paypal and Netflix. As you can see Javascript is very popular and is continuing to grow with new framworks and libraries.

              <p>
                When I first started learning PHP I was impressed with how easy it is to embed code into your HTML. The way tools are implemented allow me to speed up my production time. Database management is also very simple to manage. Overall PHP is probably the easiest back-end language to learn. Another positive is its community size. Most questions you have while building an app are answered on StackOverflow or a Github thread. Some popular websites that use PHP as their back end language are Facebook, Wikipedia, Yahoo, Tumblr, and Wordpress.

              <p>
                I've been using iOS and OSX for over a decade so I'm use to the tools of each operating system. Swift is a language created by Apple that used an IDE called Xcode to build its application. If you plan on releasing an app in Apple's app store, Xcode is simple the best program you can use. There are cross platform applications that allow you to deploy your app to Apple's AppStore and Google's PlayStore, but they don't tap into the extra features build into Xcode. Xcode also allows you to draw your view as opposed to just using HTML, CSS, & JS.

                Java was the language that helped me understand object oriented programming. I also lean towards Java when practicing Data Structures & Algorithms. The language has a huge community. Stack Overflow has tons of threads answering Java questions. Lastly, if you develop android apps Java should be your language of choice.

                Music Engineer

                For about 4-5 years I've done work as a music engineer. I'm very proficient operating Pro Tools, Logic Pro, Cubase, and FL Studio with experience in sound compression, equalization, delay, reverb, etc. (mixing). Because music has shifted from analog to digital, software engineering is a huge part of the industry's future growth. With its close ties, mixing is how I was introduced to building software.
