        <p><b>Everywhere Software</b> is a technology company founded by Dontrell Washington.</p>
        <p> My goal is simplifying the relationship between client and developer. Too often, developers fail to
          communicate with clients throughout the development stages of a project, resulting in a product that fails to
          reach the customer's end goal.</p>
        <p>For this reason, I utilize a development pattern that focuses on constant communication and transparent
          design templates. My projects are crafted to the client's specifications by giving daily updates. This ensures
          a product aligning with the client's objective. The end result is the right product.</p>
